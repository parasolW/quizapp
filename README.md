## Description

A quizz application using Spring boot + JPA + Postgresql. In this application, users have the option to either generate a quiz or take a quiz challenge, and a score will be calculated based on their responses.
Further implementation:
- [] Add user entity, so that they can store their information, quizs they created and the highest score history in the DB.
- [] Add role security, so that only user who own the quiz has the right to modify it.
